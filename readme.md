Juan Leeâ€™s Decision Problem
--------------
It is January 10th, and Juan Lee is currently a fourth year undergraduate in Management Science at Sloan. He has decided to seek out a job as a consultant. He already has received an offer from ABC consulting for $72,000 per year. He has until February 1st to decide whether to accept the offer. An old classmate of his, Mary Kumar, has told him that she has recommended him highly to her consulting firm, and feels that there is an excellent chance that they would give him an offer for $80,000. However, they are not prepared to make any decision until February 15th. If they made him an offer, he would need to decide by March 1. He also has the option of taking part in the consulting job fair in the middle of March. He is fairly certain that he could get a consulting job at that time, but is uncertain as to what he would be paid.
